This child theme is useful for simple overriding the files in the theme root.

The files should be duplicated in this child theme with all related theme files i.e. for the content.php file you have to copy also the content.post.header.php and content.post.footer.php from the layouts/ directory.

In order to override the theme CSS files we recommend to use the override.css file from the Advanced theme options.

In the future we'll implement bigger support for overriding files through the child themes (CSS/JS).
